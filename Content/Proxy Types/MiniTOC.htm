        <p>The Mini-TOC Proxy is used to generate a portion of your TOC or topic headings at a particular location in the output. Mini-TOC&#160;proxies are usually placed in topics, although it's not uncommon for them to be in MasterPages.</p>
        <h2>Viewing the Mini-TOC Proxy in this project source</h2>
        <p class="FlareLocation"><span class="PathName">Content Explorer</span> &gt; <span class="PathName">In This Guide.htm</span></p>
        <h2>How the MiniTOC Proxy works in this project</h2>
        <p>The Mini-TOC&#160;is inserted into a topic where all the proxy types are listed as children of that topic (see the Master TOC file). As such, each of the children to the In This Guide.htm topic will appear where the Mini-TOC&#160;proxy is placed.</p>

        <h2>Try it! Inserting a Menu Proxy</h2>
        <p>Create a new MasterPage by right clicking <span class="PathName">Content Explorer</span> &gt; <span class="PathName">Resources </span>&gt; <span class="PathName">MasterPages </span>and selecting New &gt; MasterPage. Once the new MasterPage is in place, click Insert &gt; Proxy &gt; Insert Menu Proxy in the MasterPage. Note that the menu proxy and body proxy typically require some extra styling to get them to show up side-by-side.</p>
